# 🔐 Rail Fence Cipher Implementation (Python)

A complete and educational Python implementation of the Rail Fence Cipher encryption algorithm.
This project demonstrates zigzag-based transposition encryption and decryption using structured logic.

It is created as a learning and academic project to understand how classical transposition cryptography works internally, not as a production-ready security system.

## ✨ Features

### 🔢 Rail-Based Zigzag Pattern
- Uses a numerical key (number of rails)
- Writes plaintext in a zigzag pattern
- Rearranges characters without substitution
- Demonstrates classical transposition technique

### 🔒 Encryption
- Removes spaces before processing
- Arranges characters across rails
- Reads row by row to produce ciphertext
- Maintains character order logic correctly

### 🔓 Decryption
- Reconstructs zigzag pattern
- Restores original message structure
- Reverses encryption algorithm accurately

### 🧮 Educational Focus
- Clean and readable logic
- Modular encryption & decryption functions
- Ideal for beginners in cryptography
- No external dependencies

## 🔎 Example

> Encryption :

```bash
Encrypt or Decrypt (E/D): E
Enter message:  MEET ME TOMORROW
Enter number of rails: 2

Encrypted message: MEMTMROETEOORW
```

> Decryption :

```bash
Encrypt or Decrypt (E/D): D
Enter message: MEMTMROETEOORW
Enter number of rails: 2

Decrypted message: MEETMETOMORROW
```

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Not secure for real-world use
- Classical cipher (easily breakable)
- Small key space (limited rails)
- Removes spaces during processing
- CLI-based interaction only

---

## 🌟 Future Improvements

- Preserve spaces and formatting
- Add brute-force rail testing mode
- Add frequency analysis support
- Add input validation for rail values
- Create GUI version
- Combine into a classical cryptography toolkit

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This implementation is created **for educational and learning purposes only.**
The Rail Fence Cipher is historically significant but cryptographically insecure and must not be used to protect real-world sensitive data.
